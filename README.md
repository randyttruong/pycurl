# pycURL 
This is my current implementation of the famous `cURL` program. pycURL 
originally started as a small project to develop a simple HTTP client; however,
I want to extend the functionality of pycURL for particularly web 
scraping purposes. 

## Current Features: 
* URL parsing 
* GET request interface 
* Redirect handling 

## Intended Features: 
* HEAD request flag 
* OOB exporting functionality
